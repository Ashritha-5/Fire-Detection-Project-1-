# Fire Detection Using Deep Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fire from images using deep learning techniques. It contains three Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different approaches:
1. *Basic CNN Model:* Initial convolutional neural network model, which achieved limited accuracy.  
2. *Feature-Enhanced Model:* Added custom features and preprocessing to improve performance.  
3. *Transfer Learning:* Leveraged pretrained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) to further improve accuracy and reliability.

The project demonstrates the iterative process of refining models for effective fire detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of fire and non-fire images. It is included in the repository under the fire_dataset/ folder.
